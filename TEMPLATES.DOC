PRESS: SUPPORTED TEMPLATE ELEMENTS

HTML templates may contain the following arguments. This is a very short
list for now, and it will probably see only minimal extension.

.Title
	The title for the content. By default, this value is pulled from
	the first <h1> element found in the content being templatized.

.Content
	The entire text of the content file passed to the command line.
