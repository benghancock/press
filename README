PRESS: README
---------------------------------------------------

Building websites that are unique is fun, and it is still useful to
craft HTML when putting together web content. But some automation is
handy to make maintaining even small websites manageable.

'press' is a simple utility written in Go for applying templates to HTML
content. This allows the user to keep a single file for components such
as the page metadata and footer, and apply that template to multiple
content files, filling in elements of the template appropriately.

When invoked at the command line, 'press' takes arguments for which
content should be templatized, in the following fashion:

    press -t template1.html -c page_content.html > output.html

The idea is that the tool can be used in scripts to aid in generating
basic static websites, reducing duplication and increasing maintainability.

This project is a work-in-progress.
