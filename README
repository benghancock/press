PRESS: README
---------------------------------------------------

press is a simple utility written in go for templatizing HTML documents.
When invoked at the command line, it takes arguments for which content
should be templatized, in the following fashion:

    press -t template1.html -c page_content.html > output.html

The idea is that the tool can be used in scripts to aid in generating
basic static websites, reducing duplication and increasing maintainability.

This project is a work-in-progress.
