PRESS: README


Overview
-----------------------------

Building websites that are unique is fun, and it is still useful to
craft HTML when putting together web content. But some automation is
handy to make maintaining even small websites manageable.

'press' is a simple utility written in Go for applying templates to HTML
content. This allows the user to keep a single file for components such
as the page metadata and footer, and apply that template to multiple
content files, filling in elements of the template appropriately.

This project is a work-in-progress


Usage
-----------------------------

When invoked at the command line, 'press' takes arguments for which
content should be templatized, in the following fashion:

    press -t template1.html -c page_content.html > output.html

The idea is that the tool can be used in scripts to aid in generating
basic static websites, reducing duplication and increasing maintainability.
Still, this is a simple project. If you're looking for something more
full-featured to build your blog or static site, or are not keen to
write raw HTML, try Hugo.

For a list of supported command line arguments, run:

	press -h

This repository also includes a sample website project with a script
utilizing 'press' to illustrate how it can be employed. To give an
idea, here is how you might want to organize your site's 'src/'
directory for use with 'press'.

	src
	├── content
	│   ├── about.html
	│   └── code.html
	├── templates
	│   └── pages.html
	└── index.html


Build/Install
-----------------------------

Assuming that you have Go installed on your system, installation should
be as simple as:

	go install github.com/benghancock/press

If you already have the repository and want to just install from the
root directory, leaving out the package name in the above command should
be sufficient.
